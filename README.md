## Project Overview


This lab demonstrates the core logic of an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process with a focus on **extraction strategies** using Python. It simulates how an analyst or data engineer might process real-world sports performance data using both full and incremental extraction methods. The core of this project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook and uses custom-generated synthetic sports data for a realistic feel.

---

## What the Notebook Does

The Jupyter Notebook contains:

- **Synthetic data generation** of 200 sports records with fields such as `player_id`,`player_name`,`team`,`match_date`,`points_scored`,`assists`,`rebounds`,`last_updated`
- **Full extraction** logic that retrieves all data from the CSV file regardless of when it was last updated.
- **Incremental extraction** logic that only fetches records **after** a stored timestamp (`last_extraction.txt`).
- Updating the `last_extraction.txt` file after each successful incremental extract to ensure only new data is processed next time.
-Proper date-time handling, even when the dataset has dates **without timestamps**.

## 🧬 Data Used

The dataset consists of **synthetically generated basketball performance records**, containing 200 rows and the following fields:

| Column Name      | Description                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `player_id`      | Unique identifier for each player             |
| `player_name`    | Name of the player                            |
| `team`           | The player’s team name                        |
| `match_date`     | Date when the match occurred (`YYYY-MM-DD`)   |
| `points_scored`  | Number of points scored in the match          |
| `assists`        | Number of assists made                        |
| `rebounds`       | Number of rebounds made                       |
| `last_updated`   | Date the record was last modified (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |

Note: Since the data only contains dates (no timestamps), the script appends `"00:00:00"` to standardize them for comparison during incremental extraction.

## Extraction Methods

### Full Extraction

- Extracts all data from the CSV file.
- Used for first-time extraction or when no historical extraction file exists.

### Incremental Extraction

- Compares each record’s `last_updated` date to the timestamp stored in `last_extraction.txt`.
- Only extracts **new or updated records**.
- Updates the timestamp in `last_extraction.txt` to reflect the latest data processed.
